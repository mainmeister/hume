Minimal Philips Hue control utility (work-in-progress).

This project starts as a single-script prototype and evolves into a minimal, testable utility with proper configuration, logging, and tests.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.12+
- uv (dependency manager)

Install uv:
- Linux/macOS: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Windows (PowerShell): `iwr https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex`

Set up the environment and install locked dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the script directly without a global install:

```bash
# Required at runtime
export HUE_USER_ID="<your-registered-user-id>"

# Optional (defaults to 192.168.1.2)
export HUE_BRIDGE_IP="192.168.1.2"

# Optional logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# Optional request timeout (seconds)
export REQUEST_TIMEOUT="5"

uv run python main.py
```

Note: Network calls happen only when executed as a script (not at import). A timeout is always applied to prevent hangs when the bridge is unreachable.

When you run `python main.py`, it will first fetch and print the Hue bridge root state, then start the interactive mood lighting application. Press ESC (or Ctrl-C) to stop; bulbs will be restored to their original state.

To only display the Hue bridge configuration and exit without starting mood lighting, use the list flag:

- `uv run python main.py --list` (or `-l`)

## Environment Variables

- HUE_USER_ID (required at runtime)
  - The Hue bridge user name/token. Do not commit this to version control.
- HUE_BRIDGE_IP (optional; default: `192.168.1.2`)
  - IP address of your Hue Bridge.
- LOG_LEVEL (optional; default: `INFO`)
  - Standard Python logging level.
- REQUEST_TIMEOUT (optional; default: `5.0`)
  - Timeout (in seconds) for network requests.
- HUE_MOOD_MAX_SECONDS (optional; default: `30.0`)
  - Maximum transition duration used by mood lighting when picking a random duration.
- HUE_MOOD_BULBS (optional)
  - Comma-separated list of bulb names to run mood lighting on. If not set, only bulbs of
    type "Extended color light" discovered on the bridge will be used by default.

CLI equivalents:
- --list or -l: print the Hue bridge configuration and exit (no mood lighting)
- --mood-max-seconds or -M
- --bulbs or -b

Precedence: CLI options > environment variables > bridge discovery defaults.

## Testing

Run all tests using Pythonâ€™s unittest:

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Integration tests are skipped by default. To enable them (requires a reachable Hue Bridge and correct env vars):

```bash
INTEGRATION=1 uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Troubleshooting

- Missing HUE_USER_ID: Set `HUE_USER_ID` and re-run. Example: `export HUE_USER_ID=...`
- Timeouts or connection errors: Verify `HUE_BRIDGE_IP` and network connectivity; adjust `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` if necessary.
- Logging verbosity: Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see detailed diagnostics.

## Mood Lighting

Start a real-time random dynamic mood loop for a light by name (runs in a daemon thread):

```bash
uv run python - <<'PY'
import os, time, main
os.environ.setdefault("HUE_USER_ID", "<your-user-id>")
os.environ.setdefault("HUE_BRIDGE_IP", "192.168.1.2")
main.setup_logging("INFO")
# Start the mood thread for the light named "Living Room"
t = main.start_mood_thread("Living Room")
# Let it run for a minute (thread continues until process exits)
time.sleep(60)
PY
```

- Configure logging and timeouts via the same env vars described above.
- Control the maximum random transition duration for mood lighting via either:
  - Environment: `export HUE_MOOD_MAX_SECONDS=10.0`
  - CLI flag: `uv run python main.py --mood-max-seconds 10.0` (or `-M 10.0`)
- Selecting bulbs for mood lighting:
  - Default: all bulbs discovered on the bridge are used.
  - Environment: `export HUE_MOOD_BULBS="Kitchen,Living Room"`
  - CLI flag: `uv run python main.py --bulbs "Kitchen,Living Room"` (or `-b "Kitchen,Living Room"`)
- Ensure the bridge is reachable; each request uses a timeout to prevent hangs.

### Stopping mood lighting safely

- When running `python main.py` directly, you can press ESC (or Ctrl-C) to stop the
  application loop. All mood threads are signaled to stop and each bulb is restored to its
  original color, brightness, and on/off state.
- Programmatic control: supply a threading.Event to `start_mood_thread()` and set it to
  request a clean stop with restoration.

Example:

```python
import threading, time, main
stop_event = threading.Event()
main.setup_logging("INFO")
# Start for one bulb with cooperative stop
thread = main.start_mood_thread("Living Room", stop_event)
# Let it run briefly
time.sleep(5)
# Ask it to stop and wait
stop_event.set()
thread.join()
```

## Development
This project will create a real time random dynamic mood lighting based 
on the hue color bulbs.
A method named mood will be created that will run as a thread.
A single argument will be passed which is the name of the bulb.
1. If the bulb is currently off then turn it on.
2. Get the current color and brightness of the bulb.
3. Generate a random color and brightness.
4. Generate a random transition time between 0.5 seconds and a configurable maximum (default 30.0 seconds).
5. Calculate the number of 0.1 second steps to get to the new color.
6. Calculate the increment in brightness for each step.
7. Calculate the increment in color for each step.
8. Loop through the number of steps and set the new color and brightness.
9. Sleep for 0.1 seconds.
10. Repeat.
